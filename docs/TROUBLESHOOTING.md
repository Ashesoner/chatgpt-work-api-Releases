# CWapi 2.0 Troubleshooting

[English](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) | [简体中文](TROUBLESHOOTING.zh-CN.md)

Use this guide from the symptom you can actually see. Check [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md) first if the setup has never worked at all.

## ChatGPT does not show the MCP tools

**Symptom**

The Coding app does not expose `coding_open` / `coding_exec` / `coding_status` / `coding_close` / `load_skill`, or the Agent app does not expose `agent_open` / `agent_exchange` / `agent_close`.

**Likely cause**

The wrong MCP app/Tunnel is connected, the Tunnel is not running, or the ChatGPT workspace has not enabled the required custom MCP capability.

**What to check**

- Coding and Agent use separate Tunnels.
- CWapi shows the corresponding Tunnel as connected/running rather than reconnecting.
- The ChatGPT app is connected through Secure MCP Tunnel, not a direct `127.0.0.1` Server URL.
- The discovered tool list matches the exact public tools above.

**How to fix**

Reconnect the correct Tunnel/app. If discovery still fails, restart only the affected Tunnel connection and verify its Tunnel ID and Runtime API key before touching repository state.

## Tunnel cannot connect

**Symptom**

The Coding or Agent Tunnel never reaches a connected state.

**Likely cause**

Invalid Tunnel ID, invalid/missing Runtime API key, blocked outbound connectivity, or a missing/broken bundled tunnel runtime.

**What to check**

- Tunnel ID belongs to the intended Coding or Agent Tunnel.
- Runtime API key is the one authorized for that Tunnel.
- `runtime/tunnel/current/tunnel-client.exe` exists in the portable.
- Local firewall/proxy policy allows the tunnel client to make its outbound connection.

**How to fix**

Re-enter the matching Tunnel ID and Runtime API key in the correct CWapi panel. Do not paste the Runtime API key into `cwapi.json`; CWapi stores it in Windows Credential Manager.

## Tunnel keeps reconnecting

**Symptom**

The GUI repeatedly shows reconnecting after an initial start or after an unexpected tunnel-client exit.

**Likely cause**

The tunnel process starts but cannot remain authenticated/connected, or the local target/profile is invalid.

**What to check**

- The reconnecting surface is the one you intended to configure.
- Coding Tunnel points only to Coding MCP; Agent Tunnel points only to Agent MCP.
- The saved Tunnel ID is correct.
- The corresponding Runtime API key still exists in Windows Credential Manager.

**How to fix**

Correct the affected Tunnel configuration and reconnect it. Do not copy one surface's Tunnel settings into the other.

## Runtime API key is rejected

**Symptom**

The tunnel client fails authentication even though the Tunnel ID looks correct.

**Likely cause**

Wrong, expired, revoked, or insufficiently authorized Runtime API key.

**What to check**

Coding key target:

```text
CWapi/2.0/OpenAI/Tunnel/APIKey
```

Agent key target:

```text
CWapi/2.0/OpenAI/Tunnel/Agent/APIKey
```

**How to fix**

Create/use a valid Runtime API key for the intended Tunnel and save it through the matching CWapi Tunnel panel so it replaces the correct Credential Manager entry.

## `CODING_WORKSPACE_BUSY`

**Symptom**

`coding_open(..., resume=false)` returns `CODING_WORKSPACE_BUSY`.

**Likely cause**

That canonical repository + target ref already has an active Coding session.

**What to check**

Call `coding_status(repository_url, target_ref)` and confirm that this is the repository/branch/task you intend to continue. If multiple branches are active and `target_ref` is omitted, expect `CODING_SESSION_AMBIGUOUS`.

**How to fix**

If continuing the same compatible task, use:

```text
coding_open(..., resume=true)
```

If the old branch task is genuinely finished, close it with `coding_close(repository_url, target_ref)`. Different branches may be active concurrently; do not work around same-branch ownership by changing URL spelling.

## `CODING_SESSION_AMBIGUOUS`

**Symptom**

A repository-only `coding_exec`, `coding_status`, or `coding_close` fails because the same repository has multiple active branches.

**How to fix**

Repeat the call with the intended `target_ref`. CWapi never chooses the newest, oldest, or arbitrary branch. If the named target is not active, the result is `CODING_SESSION_NOT_ACTIVE`; it does not fall back to another branch.

## Codex runtime unavailable

**Symptom**

Coding opens but `coding_exec` cannot start because the bundled Codex command toolhost/runtime is missing or unavailable.

**Likely cause**

The portable was only partially copied/extracted, runtime files were removed, or security software blocked the bundled executable.

**What to check**

- You extracted the complete release, not only `CWapi.exe`.
- The pinned Codex runtime exists under `runtime/codex/current`.
- Security software did not quarantine it.

**How to fix**

Re-extract the complete official `CWapi-v2.0.5.zip` into a clean user-writable directory. Do not replace the bundled runtime with an arbitrary Codex installation.

## Private Git clone/fetch/push fails

**Symptom**

Public repositories work, but a private repository returns Git authentication errors.

**Likely cause**

The current Windows user does not have working Git/GitHub credentials for that repository.

**What to check**

Verify the same Windows user can authenticate to the repository with normal Git tooling outside CWapi.

**How to fix**

Repair the Windows user's Git/GitHub credential setup. CWapi does not use a Codex login as Git authentication. Do not put GitHub tokens in prompts or repository files.

## Commit or push fails in SAFE

**Symptom**

Normal edits/tests work, but `git commit`, `git push`, or another Git metadata operation fails under SAFE.

**Likely cause**

SAFE intentionally protects `.git` metadata and broader host access.

**What to check**

Confirm the user explicitly authorized the Git write and inspect the intended staged files first.

**How to fix**

Switch Coding to `FULL`, then run the exact authorized Git command. Switch back to SAFE afterward for normal work. A command already running keeps the profile it started with.

## A new ChatGPT conversation cannot resume the workspace

**Symptom**

`coding_open(..., resume=true)` does not resume the expected workspace.

**Likely cause**

The repository URL/target ref/expected commit is incompatible with the existing workspace metadata, the workspace was moved without `CWapi-data`, or the previous active state was closed and the requested resume contract no longer matches.

**What to check**

- Use the same canonical repository URL.
- Use the same compatible `target_ref`.
- If `expected_commit` is supplied, it matches the stored resolved commit.
- The current CWapi directory contains the original `CWapi-data/workspaces` tree.

**How to fix**

Resume using matching parameters. If you intentionally want a new baseline, first preserve any important local work, then rebuild the workspace through CWapi's maintenance flow rather than deleting files blindly.

## An old `coding_attachment` tool still appears

**Symptom**

The ChatGPT Coding app shows five tools or still lists `coding_attachment`.

**Likely cause**

The connected MCP app is using an older server/catalog rather than the CWapi 2.0.5 Coding route.

**How to fix**

Confirm that CWapi 2.0.5 and its Coding Tunnel are running, reconnect the Coding app, and verify the exact five-tool catalog. Coding MCP no longer transfers files or images.

## `AGENT_FILE_ATTACHMENTS_UNSUPPORTED`

**Symptom**

A local Agent request is rejected with `AGENT_FILE_ATTACHMENTS_UNSUPPORTED`.

**Likely cause**

The client sent CWapi's unsupported generic top-level `attachments` file extension.

**What to check**

Inspect the client request shape. Agent accepts text and tool JSON only.

**How to fix**

Remove the top-level `attachments` field. Provide textual context or use the local application's own tools to inspect local data.

## `AGENT_MEDIA_INPUT_UNSUPPORTED`

**Symptom**

A local Agent request is rejected with `AGENT_MEDIA_INPUT_UNSUPPORTED`.

**Likely cause**

One or more Chat Completions message content parts are not `text`, for example an `image_url` part.

**How to fix**

Send text-only message content and tool JSON. CWapi does not enqueue or return file/image content through Agent MCP.

## Agent Provider returns 401 `invalid_api_key`

**Symptom**

`GET /v1/models` or `POST /v1/chat/completions` returns HTTP 401.

**Likely cause**

The local client is missing the Agent Provider API key or is using an old/wrong key.

**What to check**

The API key is the Agent key shown by CWapi and stored in `CWapi-data/config/cwapi.json`. It is not the Tunnel Runtime API key.

**How to fix**

Update the local client's Bearer/API-key field with CWapi's current Agent Provider API key.

## Agent Provider returns 429 `AGENT_BUSY`

**Symptom**

The local client receives HTTP 429 `AGENT_BUSY`.

**Likely cause**

The bounded Agent broker is full/busy. Defaults are up to 4 in-flight requests and a queue of 16.

**What to check**

Confirm the ChatGPT Agent bridge is actively running `agent_exchange` and previous requests are being completed.

**How to fix**

Reduce local request concurrency and let pending/claimed requests finish. Do not solve queue pressure by opening multiple competing Agent bridges.

## Agent Provider returns 503

**Symptom**

The local client receives HTTP 503, commonly `AGENT_BRIDGE_UNAVAILABLE` / unavailable.

**Likely cause**

There is no usable active Agent MCP bridge, the Agent Tunnel/app is disconnected, or the exchange loop is not running.

**What to check**

- Agent Tunnel is connected to Agent MCP.
- ChatGPT exposes `agent_open`, `agent_exchange`, `agent_close`.
- `agent_open()` has opened/resumed the bridge.
- The conversation continues calling `agent_exchange` during the continuous task.

**How to fix**

Restore the Agent Tunnel/app connection, call `agent_open`, and keep the exchange loop active.

## Agent Provider returns 504 `AGENT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`

**Symptom**

A local Chat Completions request eventually returns HTTP 504.

**Likely cause**

The request did not receive a completed Web GPT response before the current default 180-second request timeout.

**What to check**

Confirm `agent_exchange` actually received the request and that the response was returned under the exact `request_id`.

**How to fix**

Keep the Agent exchange loop active and finish each request within the deadline. Reduce oversized/overly complex client turns when practical.

## Local software cannot find model `cwapi-web-gpt`

**Symptom**

The client reports that the model is missing, or its model picker is empty.

**Likely cause**

The Base URL is wrong, the client does not use the custom provider you configured, or authentication fails before it can read `/v1/models`.

**What to check**

Use:

```text
Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:<agent-port>/v1
Model:    cwapi-web-gpt
```

CWapi implements `GET /v1/models` and `POST /v1/chat/completions`.

**How to fix**

Correct the custom OpenAI-compatible provider settings and Agent API key. If the client insists on unsupported OpenAI endpoints/fields, that client version may not be compatible with CWapi 2.0.

## Coding and Agent Tunnels were configured backwards

**Symptom**

The connection exists but ChatGPT discovers the wrong tool catalog, or Coding/Agent behavior appears swapped.

**Likely cause**

A Coding Tunnel was pointed at Agent MCP, or an Agent Tunnel was pointed at Coding MCP.

**What to check**

Coding must expose exactly five `coding_*` tools. Agent must expose exactly three `agent_*` tools.

**How to fix**

Correct each Tunnel to its own local MCP target and use separate Tunnel IDs/Runtime API keys/profiles.

## Workspace seems missing after moving the portable

**Symptom**

CWapi starts in a new directory but previous workspaces are not listed/available.

**Likely cause**

Only the clean program/runtime files were moved, so the new directory created a new `CWapi-data`.

**What to check**

Look in the old extracted directory for:

```text
CWapi-data/workspaces/
```

**How to fix**

Do not delete either data root until you identify the correct one. For a portable move that preserves state, move the complete extracted directory including `CWapi-data`.

## Can I delete `CWapi-data`?

**Symptom**

You want to reset CWapi or reclaim space and are considering deleting `CWapi-data`.

**Likely cause**

`CWapi-data` contains more than disposable cache: config, workspace metadata, durable repositories, and runtime state live there.

**What to check**

Before deletion, inspect whether any workspace contains uncommitted or unpushed work and note that MCP tokens, Agent API key and Tunnel IDs are also stored in config.

**How to fix**

Prefer CWapi's targeted maintenance actions for individual workspaces. If you intentionally delete the whole `CWapi-data`, treat it as a destructive reset: back up required work first and expect to reconfigure CWapi afterward.

## Still stuck?

Collect only the relevant error code, CWapi/Tunnel state, `coding_status` output when applicable, and the exact local HTTP status for Agent. Avoid posting secrets such as MCP tokens, Agent API keys, Tunnel Runtime API keys, or private repository credentials.
