# CWapi 2.0.5 Operations

## Start

Extract the portable to any user-writable directory and run `CWapi.exe`. No Go, Node, Git or Wails installation is required. The first launch creates `CWapi-data/config/cwapi.json` and starts the loopback MCP listener plus the Agent Provider when enabled. 2.0.5 also loads the global `prompts/` directory once at startup; prompt/rule/skill edits require restarting CWapi. Each bundled OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel starts only after its own configuration is complete.

Coding uses the bundled Codex app-server only for model-free `command/exec` and creates a private empty CODEX_HOME per command. No Codex login is needed. SAFE does not inherit the host Git/GitHub setup. FULL uses the current user's sanitized development environment. GitHub CLI state is shared by all Coding workspaces at `CWapi-data/auth/github`; authenticate once with `gh auth login` and keep token storage in Windows Credential Manager/keyring where supported.

## Connect

The GUI's local endpoints are for software running on the same Windows machine:

```text
Coding: http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp/coding/<token>
Agent:  http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp/agent/<token>
```

Do not paste these `127.0.0.1` URLs into ChatGPT's **Server URL** connection mode. ChatGPT cannot reach the local machine directly. Use the **Tunnel** connection mode for each ChatGPT MCP app.

Remote ChatGPT custom MCP requires an operator-selected HTTPS exposure layer. Keep Coding and Agent URLs separate; never reuse their tokens or tunnel credentials.

For the bundled OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel, open the matching Coding or Agent panel and enter only:

```text
Tunnel ID:       tunnel_...
Runtime API key: <your Tunnel Runtime API key>
```

CWapi writes the matching ID to the v3 config and stores the matching Runtime API key in a separate Windows Credential Manager entry. It generates profiles at `CWapi-data/tunnel/coding/openai-tunnel.yaml` and `CWapi-data/tunnel/agent/openai-tunnel.yaml`; each profile contains an environment reference, not the key. Coding's `main` channel forwards Coding MCP only, and Agent's `main` channel forwards Agent MCP only.

A tunnel-client that fails its initial child-process launch or exits unexpectedly is retried locally up to three times with exponential backoff. The GUI shows `正在重连`; disconnecting or reconfiguring cancels a pending restart.

If both Coding and Agent will be connected as separate ChatGPT apps, create two OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnels and configure one in each panel. Do not put the Agent tunnel ID or key into the Coding panel.

Configure local software with:

```text
Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:<agent-port>/v1
API key:  <Agent API key from GUI>
Model:    cwapi-web-gpt
```

## Images and files

CWapi 2.0.5 does not provide file or image transfer.

For Coding, read source, Markdown, JSON, logs and other inspectable text through bounded `coding_exec`; there is no attachment tool.

For Agent, top-level `attachments` requests return `AGENT_FILE_ATTACHMENTS_UNSUPPORTED`, while non-text message content parts such as `image_url` return `AGENT_MEDIA_INPUT_UNSUPPORTED`. `agent_exchange` carries request JSON only and emits no MCP file/image content.

For long Agent workflows, local software may add bounded top-level `metadata` strings such as `task_id` and `correlation_id`. These are surfaced on each MCP request and remain separate from the random OpenAI `request_id` and any local command session. Web GPT should read exchange `activity` for broker truth. `no_request` means only that no new OpenAI request arrived during the wait window; inspect the actual local process/artifact before waiting again.

A file or image uploaded in the ChatGPT conversation is never written into the local workspace or Agent software.

## Access profile

- SAFE: source inspection, edits and tests under `workspaceWrite`, a synthetic profile, isolated host configuration and workspace-lifetime caches. SAFE is the profile that limits Agent reach outside the owned workspace；
- FULL: every command that passes the small permanent catastrophic guard runs with `dangerFullAccess` and the current Windows user's sanitized development environment. Normal Git, GitHub CLI, SDK, package-manager, hook, signing and process-control behavior is available. FULL is not a shell-language sandbox；
- Network: independent OFF/ON capability for both profiles；
- Remote Git Rewrite: independent advanced OFF/ON capability. It defaults OFF and controls direct force/delete remote updates only。

SAFE/FULL, Coding network access and Remote Git Rewrite may be switched while Coding sessions remain open. An already running `coding_exec` keeps the capabilities selected when it started; the next execution uses the new settings. Remote operations require network access. Other service-restart configuration mutations remain blocked while Coding work is active.

Foreground `coding_exec` remains bounded and cleans its process tree when it completes, times out or is cancelled. For a development server, watcher, GUI or browser-auth flow, use `action=start`; retain the returned `process_id`, inspect it with `action=status`, and terminate it with `action=stop`. Closing the workspace session or exiting CWapi also stops its persistent processes. Persistent output is bounded and status polling is non-blocking.

## Workspace recovery

An interrupted Coding task leaves the durable workspace intact. A ChatGPT conversation ending does not automatically close the CWapi Coding session. If the same repository + target ref already has an active session, a new conversation should call compatible `coding_open(..., resume=true)`; CWapi reuses that branch's active internal session without preparing a second workspace or requiring a public session ID. Different branches of one repository may remain active concurrently.

`resume=false` against an active repository + target ref still returns `CODING_WORKSPACE_BUSY`. New preparation checks out or creates the local target branch with origin tracking and only fast-forwards a clean branch with no local/diverged commits. Dirty work and local history are never reset implicitly. Direct local-destructive Git commands create bounded `refs/cwapi/safety/*` recovery refs when possible. A clean workspace with metadata interrupted during write is repaired by the next non-resume `coding_open`; resume still refuses to guess a corrupt context. Use the Desktop maintenance overlay only when a selected repository + branch should be opened or deleted/rebuilt. Delete/Rebuild is branch-scoped and loses uncommitted local work in that selected workspace; original V1 64-hex branch-aware and upstream repository-only workspaces are never auto-migrated and are manageable only when metadata exactly matches repository + target ref.

## Move or upgrade

Moving the entire extracted directory moves its adjacent `CWapi-data`. Moving only the clean program/runtime creates a fresh data root in the new location.

Before replacing 2.0.5 with branch-aware V1, close active sessions, exit CWapi, and back up the complete `CWapi-data` plus any unpushed workspace changes. Keep the original 2.0.5 installation for rollback. Original V1 64-hex branch-aware and upstream repository-only workspace directories are not auto-migrated. To roll back, exit V1, restore the pre-upgrade `CWapi-data` backup beside the original 2.0.5 build, then start that original build. Do not copy `CWapi-data` into a release ZIP.

## Failure triage

- The GUI shows only the current bounded error code. It deliberately omits raw paths, credentials and log history；
- MCP not reachable: confirm app runtime state, port and exact token URL；
- OpenAI Tunnel blocked: confirm Tunnel ID and Runtime API key; verify the bundled tunnel-client is present in `runtime/tunnel/current`；
- OpenAI Tunnel failed after automatic retries: inspect the GUI state and reconnect; do not put the Runtime API key into `cwapi.json` or an environment file；
- Codex unavailable: verify the bundled runtime lock/hash and Windows sandbox readiness；
- private clone fails: verify the CWapi workspace manager's current-user GitHub credentials；
- remote Git/network command fails: enable Coding network access, then retry；
- force/delete push fails with `REMOTE_GIT_REWRITE_DISABLED`: enable the advanced Remote Git Rewrite capability only when that exact remote history change is intended；
- persistent command returns a terminal state: stop polling that process ID and advance the task；
- `AGENT_FILE_ATTACHMENTS_UNSUPPORTED`: local Agent software attempted file transfer; file transfer is disabled；
- `AGENT_MEDIA_INPUT_UNSUPPORTED`: local Agent software attempted image or other non-text message content; media transfer is disabled；
- Agent 503: open Agent MCP bridge；
- Agent 429: wait for pending/claimed work to finish；
- Agent 504: Web GPT did not answer before request timeout；
- repeated Agent `no_request`: check `activity.changed/idle_count`; do not infer a running command, and after two unchanged waits re-check the local process and expected artifacts；
- config mutation rejected: close active Coding/Agent work first。
