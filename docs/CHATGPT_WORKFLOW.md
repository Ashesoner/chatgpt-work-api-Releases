# CWapi 2.0 ChatGPT Workflow

## First-contact operating manual

2.0.5 将 first-contact prompt 分成全局文件，而不是把大量经验硬编码进 Go 常量。CWapi 启动时扫描并缓存一次 `prompts/`：Coding 与 Agent 各有独立 Core/Rules，共享 Skills。MCP initialize 的 `instructions` 只拼接当前 mode 的 Core + Rules + Skill 清单（ID/name/Description），Skill body 由 `load_skill(name)` 按 Rules 需要加载。

Core 只描述通信协议与工具使用；Rules 描述 mode-specific 行为和 Skill routing；Skills 保存 coding/debugging/git/testing/release 等任务经验。修改 Rules/Skills/Core 后必须重启 CWapi。没有 workspace-specific Skill、Profile、热加载、数据库或 GUI 管理。

单个 Skill 损坏时跳过并记录 warning；对应 enabled mode 的 Core/Rules 缺失或不可读时，该 mode 启动明确失败。协议正确性、授权、request correlation 和安全边界仍由 Go code 强制执行。

## Coding GPT

Connect a custom MCP to the Coding endpoint only. The Coding surface exposes exactly five tools:

- `coding_open`
- `coding_exec`
- `coding_status`
- `coding_close`
- `load_skill`

Coding MCP has no file or image transfer tool. Read inspectable repository text through exact `coding_exec` calls.

A typical turn is:

1. `coding_open(repository_url,target_ref,expected_commit?,resume?)`；
2. inspect/read/edit/verify with exact `coding_exec(repository_url,target_ref?,command,argv,cwd?,timeout_seconds?)` calls；
3. inspect HEAD/dirty/divergence with `coding_status(repository_url,target_ref?)` when Git truth is needed；
4. `coding_close(repository_url,target_ref?)` when the task is genuinely finished。

The Coding GPT is the only reasoning agent. CWapi sends exact commands to the bundled private Codex app-server `command/exec` development tool; it never sends an instruction to a Codex agent. Pass arguments as an argv array, not as one shell-quoted command string. In SAFE, prefer PowerShell cmdlets and repository tools that work under Windows constrained language mode.

### Repository-scoped session lifecycle

A ChatGPT conversation ending is not observable by CWapi and therefore does not automatically close an active Coding session. Web GPT does not receive or remember a random Coding session ID. The public stable identity is the repository URL.

CWapi still creates a unique internal session ID and keeps `canonical repository + canonical target_ref -> active internal session` ownership. That internal identity remains responsible for concurrent-operation exclusion, cancellation, closing, stale-operation protection and logging; removing the public ID does not remove the internal lifecycle generation.

At the start of a Coding conversation/task, call `coding_open` with repository + branch. If that repository + target ref has no active session, CWapi prepares or resumes its branch-aware durable workspace and creates an internal session. If the same repository + target ref already has an active compatible session, call `coding_open(..., resume=true)`; CWapi reuses that internal session and returns `resumed=true` instead of requiring the caller to recover an old ID. If a command is already running, the returned state may be `busy`.

`resume=false` keeps branch ownership protection: an already-active repository + target ref returns `CODING_WORKSPACE_BUSY`. A workspace still opening, a session closing, or an incompatible ref/expected commit is not silently adopted.

Continue later Coding calls with the same `repository_url` and, when more than one branch of that repository may be active, the matching `target_ref`. Different branches may be active concurrently. Omitting `target_ref` on exec/status/close is compatible only while that repository has exactly one active branch; multiple active branches return `CODING_SESSION_AMBIGUOUS`, and a named inactive branch returns `CODING_SESSION_NOT_ACTIVE` without fallback.

### Files and images

CWapi 2.0.5 does not transfer files or images through Coding MCP. There is no attachment tool and the MCP layer does not emit `ImageContent` or `EmbeddedResource`.

Read source, Markdown, JSON, logs, configuration and other text directly through `coding_exec`, using exact tools such as `rg`, `git show`, PowerShell text reads or repository-specific commands. Prefer bounded, relevant output rather than moving whole files when only part of a file is needed.

### Efficiency and safety

Inspect before editing. When several reads/searches are independent, prefer one information-rich command or a small number of grouped commands instead of many tiny round trips. Do not repeatedly re-read unchanged files without new evidence. After edits, verify with the narrowest useful test first, then broaden validation when needed. Use `coding_status` when Git/workspace truth is actually needed rather than after every small action.

Use SAFE when the task should remain confined to the owned workspace. SAFE has workspace-lifetime caches but a synthetic profile and isolated host credentials/configuration. Select FULL only when the user intends the Agent to use the current Windows user's normal development environment; FULL permits normal Git/GitHub CLI, SDK, package-manager, hooks/signing and process-control behavior, including commands invoked from PowerShell/cmd/build scripts. CWapi does not parse arbitrary shell text as a security boundary in FULL.

Network access is selected independently in either profile. Remote Git Rewrite is a separate advanced capability and defaults OFF; enable it only for an intended force/delete remote update. Unsafe push transports, receive-pack injection, CWapi recovery-ref publication, protected internal paths and automatic elevation remain denied. Potentially destructive direct local Git operations create recovery refs when possible.

For ordinary bounded work, omit `action` and use foreground `run`. For a development server, watcher, GUI or browser-auth flow, use `action=start`, retain `process_id`, inspect with bounded `action=status`, and finish with `action=stop`. A terminal process state ends polling. Closing the Coding session also stops that workspace's persistent processes.

Call `coding_close(repository_url,target_ref?)` when the task is genuinely finished. Closing releases only the selected branch active session owner. It does not reset or clean Git, delete uncommitted changes, or delete the durable workspace. If a conversation disappears before close, a later conversation uses the same repository + target ref with `coding_open(..., resume=true)`.

## Agent GPT

Connect a separate custom MCP to the Agent endpoint. The Agent surface exposes `agent_open`、`agent_exchange`、`agent_close` and shared `load_skill`。

1. `agent_open()` opens or resumes the logical bridge；
2. use `load_skill(name)` only when Agent Rules require a task Skill；
3. call `agent_exchange(capacity=4)` and process every returned request by exact `request_id`；
4. return structured responses/events and optional progress；
5. continue until structured completion, or `agent_close()` when the bridge itself should detach。

Web GPT is the sole planner. CWapi owns heartbeat, broker/request lifecycle and protocol conversion; local software executes tools. Natural-language silence is not liveness, progress is not completion, and completion is never inferred from words in assistant text.

Returned requests expose a compatibility `state=claimed` plus explicit `lifecycle_state`. A request may move through `QUEUED / CLAIMED / RUNNING / WAITING_TOOL / COMPLETED / FAILED_RETRYABLE / FAILED_FINAL`. A malformed tool call produces a structured retryable error and same-ID redelivery rather than stranding the request. Correct the call and continue.

A `delivery` greater than 1 is the same request. On bridge interruption, preserve completed steps and use `previous_state/resume_reason/last_activity`; do not restart work merely because a new internal bridge generation was created. `agent_close` detaches the bridge but does not discard active requests.

Tool-call arguments may be native JSON or OpenAI JSON string. For streamed arguments, CWapi concatenates all fragments before parsing once. Prefer several bounded tool calls over giant nested PowerShell/HTML/JS payloads because small calls are easier to retry and less fragile on Windows.

When a tool itself fails, return that failure as the normal tool result so Web GPT can decide the next action. A tool error is not automatically a final Agent failure. The local OpenAI client creates the next request containing `tool_result`; that request is tagged as such by CWapi.

Every exchange returns structured activity including revision, pending/inflight compatibility fields, queued/active request counts, heartbeat/progress observations and bounded-wait state. `no_request` means only that no new OpenAI request arrived during that wait. It does not prove a third-party process is still running.

Local clients may attach top-level `metadata`; `task_id` and `correlation_id` remain optional stable client-supplied identities. CWapi does not turn per-request IDs into fake command sessions. Independent function calls may still be returned together as standard parallel `tool_calls` when their arguments are already known.

### Agent files and media

Agent accepts text and tool JSON only. A top-level `attachments` field is rejected with `AGENT_FILE_ATTACHMENTS_UNSUPPORTED`; any non-text message content part, including `image_url`, is rejected with `AGENT_MEDIA_INPUT_UNSUPPORTED` before broker admission. `agent_exchange` emits no MCP file or image content. There is no reverse path that writes a ChatGPT conversation upload into local software.
